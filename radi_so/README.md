# The codebase of "Radi" handmade GM counter project by Dr. Satoru Ozaki

This is the codebase for analysis of handmade GM counter by [Dr. Satoru Ozaki (1945-)](https://acaddb.com/articles/authors/13148862), who is the father of Takashi J. Ozaki ([ozt-ca](https://github.com/ozt-ca/)). All contents are mirrored from [his original site](https://www.radi-edu.jp/category/experiment).

He obtained his Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, and he had worked for applied studies on nuclear reactor materials as a nuclear engineer, in Toshiba Corporation.

After he retired at 62 years old, his passion has been focused on education about uses of radiation for children. He developed a simple but practical handmade GM counter for measuring radiation, and he has attempted to spread it. At 75 years old, he started to learn Python coding, and even he gave [an academic talk](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/happyokai/1/0/1_81/_article/-char/ja/) with the Python codes and related materials at an academic conference.

Currently (Nov 17 in 2021), he has been diagnosed as having terminal cancer, and is struggling with the disease.
